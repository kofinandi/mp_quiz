<question>If we re-parameterize labels to be $y \in \{-1, 1\}$ for a perceptron, and use the Hinge Loss $L = \max(0, 1 - y_i \theta^T \mathbf{x}_i)$, what is the gradient $\nabla_\theta L$ if the point $\mathbf{x}_i$ is misclassified (i.e., $y_i \theta^T \mathbf{x}_i &lt; 1$)?</question>
<answers>
<answer correct="true">$\nabla_\theta L = -y_i \mathbf{x}_i$</answer>

<question>Consider a simple neural network layer where the loss is $L$, the output activation is $\hat{y} = \sigma(z)$, and the pre-activation is $z = a_1 w_1 + \dots$. According to the chain rule, how is $\frac{\partial L}{\partial w_1}$ expressed?</question>
<answers>
<answer correct="true">$\frac{\partial L}{\partial w_1} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \hat{y}} \frac{\partial \hat{y}}{\partial z} \frac{\partial z}{\partial w_1}$</answer>
<answer>$\frac{\partial L}{\partial w_1} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial z} \frac{\partial z}{\partial \hat{y}} \frac{\partial \hat{y}}{\partial w_1}$</answer>
<answer>$\frac{\partial L}{\partial w_1} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial a_1} \frac{\partial a_1}{\partial z} \frac{\partial z}{\partial w_1}$</answer>
<answer>$\frac{\partial L}{\partial w_1} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \hat{y}} + \frac{\partial \hat{y}}{\partial z} + \frac{\partial z}{\partial w_1}$</answer>
</answers>
<explanation>Slide 12 of the second lecture ("Backpropagation: Output Layer") shows this application of the chain rule: $\frac{\partial L}{\partial w_1} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \hat{y}} \frac{\partial \hat{y}}{\partial z} \frac{\partial z}{\partial w_1}$.</explanation>

<problem>
<question>In backpropagation, if $\delta_k^{[l+1]} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial a_k^{[l+1]}}$ is the error signal at the input (pre-activation $a_k^{[l+1]}$) of neuron $k$ in layer $l+1$, and $a_k^{[l+1]} = \sum_j w_{kj}^{[l+1]} z_j^{[l]} + b_k^{[l+1]}$ where $z_j^{[l]}$ is the output of neuron $j$ in layer $l$, how is the error signal $\frac{\partial L}{\partial z_j^{[l]}}$ (error at the output of neuron $j$ in layer $l$) computed?</question>
<answers>
<answer correct="true">$\frac{\partial L}{\partial z_j^{[l]}} = \sum_k \delta_k^{[l+1]} \sigma'(a_k^{[l+1]}) w_{kj}^{[l+1]}$ (assuming $\delta_k^{[l+1]}$ is error at output of neuron k, and $z_k^{[l+1]} = \sigma(a_k^{[l+1]})$ )</answer>
<answer>$\frac{\partial L}{\partial z_j^{[l]}} = \sum_k \frac{\partial L}{\partial a_k^{[l+1]}} w_{jk}^{[l+1]}$</answer>
<answer>$\frac{\partial L}{\partial z_j^{[l]}} = \prod_k \frac{\partial L}{\partial a_k^{[l+1]}} w_{kj}^{[l+1]}$</answer>
<answer>$\frac{\partial L}{\partial z_j^{[l]}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial a_j^{[l+1]}} \sigma'(a_j^{[l+1]})$</answer>
</answers>
<explanation>This follows from the chain rule. The error at $z_j^{[l]}$ is the sum of contributions to the error of all neurons in the next layer that $z_j^{[l]}$ connects to. Specifically, $\frac{\partial L}{\partial z_j^{[l]}} = \sum_k \frac{\partial L}{\partial a_k^{[l+1]}} \frac{\partial a_k^{[l+1]}}{\partial z_j^{[l]}}$. Given $a_k^{[l+1]} = \sum_j w_{kj}^{[l+1]} z_j^{[l]} + \dots$, then $\frac{\partial a_k^{[l+1]}}{\partial z_j^{[l]}} = w_{kj}^{[l+1]}$. If $\delta_k^{[l+1]}$ in the question means $\frac{\partial L}{\partial z_k^{[l+1]}}$, then we need an extra $\sigma'$ term. Slide 16 shows $\frac{\partial L}{\partial z_i^{[l-1]}} = \sum_j \frac{\partial L}{\partial z_j^{[l]}} \frac{\partial z_j^{[l]}}{\partial z_i^{[l-1]}}$. If $z_j^{[l]} = \sigma(a_j^{[l]})$ and $a_j^{[l]} = \sum_i W_{ji}^{[l]} z_i^{[l-1]}$, then $\frac{\partial z_j^{[l]}}{\partial z_i^{[l-1]}} = \sigma'(a_j^{[l]}) W_{ji}^{[l]}$. So, the error at the output $z_i^{[l-1]}$ is $\sum_j (\text{error at output } z_j^{[l]}) \cdot \sigma'(\text{pre-activation } a_j^{[l]}) \cdot W_{ji}^{[l]}$. The provided answer best matches this form if we interpret $\delta_k^{[l+1]}$ as the error at the *output* of neuron $k$ in layer $l+1$. A more precise question would define $\delta$ clearly.</explanation>

<question>What happens if all activation functions in a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) are linear (e.g., $\sigma(x) = \alpha x + \beta$)?</question>
<answers>
<answer correct="true">The entire MLP collapses into a single equivalent affine transformation, regardless of the number of layers.</answer>
<answer>The MLP can still approximate any continuous function, but training becomes more difficult.</answer>
<answer>The backpropagation algorithm can no longer be applied.</answer>
<answer>The network becomes highly sensitive to the initialization of its weights.</answer>
</answers>
<explanation>Slide 26 of the second lecture ("Linear Activation Functions?") explains that if $\sigma$ is a linear transform, the resulting MLP is just an affine mapping with extra steps: $f(\mathbf{x}) = V^{[L]}\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{c}^{[L]}$. This means multiple linear layers can be represented by a single linear layer.</explanation>
</problem>

<problem>
<question>The Universal Approximation Theorem (e.g., Cybenko's version) states that a single hidden layer feedforward network with a sufficient number of units and a suitable non-linear activation function can approximate any continuous function $f(\mathbf{x})$ arbitrarily well. What does this theorem NOT tell us?</question>
<answers>
<answer correct="true">It does not tell us anything about the chances of learning the correct parameters or how to find them.</answer>
<answer>It does not specify the type of non-linear activation function required (e.g., sigmoidal).</answer>
<answer>It does not guarantee that the approximation will be compact (i.e., requiring a finite number of hidden units).</answer>
<answer>It does not apply to functions with discontinuities.</answer>
</answers>
<explanation>Slide 39 of the second lecture ("Universal approximation theorem") explicitly states: "It does not tell us anything about the chances of learning the correct parameters." While Cybenko's theorem focuses on sigmoidal activations, the general idea is about existence, not learnability or practical considerations like the number of units.</explanation>

<question>What phenomenon was observed in the "Randomization Test" experiments (Zhang et al., 2017) regarding deep neural networks?</question>
<answers>
<answer correct="true">Deep neural networks can easily achieve zero training error even when training on data with random labels or random pixels.</answer>
<answer>Deep neural networks generalize poorly when trained on small datasets, irrespective of label correctness.</answer>
<answer>Explicit regularization (like weight decay) is strictly necessary for deep neural networks to fit the training data.</answer>
<answer>The architecture of the neural network is the most critical factor for fitting random data, more so than the optimization algorithm.</answer>
</answers>
<explanation>Slides 45-50 of the second lecture discuss the Randomization Test. Slide 50 summarizes: "Easy to have zero training error even with random labelling and random inputs." This implies a high capacity to memorize, even noise.</explanation>

<question>The "Double Descent" phenomenon in deep learning refers to the observation that:</question>
<answers>
<answer correct="true">Test error can first decrease, then increase (overfitting), and then decrease again as model complexity (e.g., width, number of parameters) or training time increases beyond a certain "interpolation threshold".</answer>
<answer>Training error and test error both decrease twice during the training process due to two distinct phases of learning.</answer>
<answer>The learning rate needs to be decreased twice (double descent) during training to achieve optimal performance.</answer>
<answer>The bias of the model decreases twice, while the variance increases twice, leading to a complex trade-off.</answer>
</answers>
<explanation>Slide 54 of the second lecture ("The Phenomena of Double Descent") illustrates this. In the "Modern Regime: Larger Model is Better", test error decreases after initially increasing past the classical overfitting point, as model size/capacity grows beyond the interpolation threshold.</explanation>
</problem>

<problem>
<question>What is the Effective Model Complexity (EMC), as proposed by Nakkiran et al. to help formalize the double descent phenomenon?</question>
<answers>
<answer correct="true">The maximum number of samples $n$ on which a given training procedure $\mathcal{T}$ achieves on average (near) zero training error.</answer>
<answer>The total number of trainable parameters in the neural network model.</answer>
<answer>A measure of the VC dimension of the model class used.</answer>
<answer>The inverse of the generalization gap observed on a held-out test set.</answer>
</answers>
<explanation>Slide 57 of the second lecture ("How Do We Formalize Double Descent?") defines EMC: "Given training procedure $\mathcal{T}$, data samples $S = \{(\mathbf{x}_1, y_1), \dots, (\mathbf{x}_n, y_n)\}$, and outputs $\mathcal{T}(S)$, the EMC is the maximum number of samples $n$ on which $\mathcal{T}$ achieves on average zero training error."</explanation>

<question>According to the multivariable chain rule for Jacobians, if $\mathbf{z} = f(\mathbf{y})$ and $\mathbf{y} = g(\mathbf{x})$, how is the Jacobian $\frac{\partial \mathbf{z}}{\partial \mathbf{x}}$ expressed?</question>
<answers>
<answer correct="true">$\frac{\partial \mathbf{z}}{\partial \mathbf{x}} = \frac{\partial \mathbf{z}}{\partial \mathbf{y}} \frac{\partial \mathbf{y}}{\partial \mathbf{x}}$</answer>
<answer>$\frac{\partial \mathbf{z}}{\partial \mathbf{x}} = \frac{\partial \mathbf{y}}{\partial \mathbf{x}} \frac{\partial \mathbf{z}}{\partial \mathbf{y}}$</answer>
<answer>$\frac{\partial \mathbf{z}}{\partial \mathbf{x}} = \frac{\partial \mathbf{z}}{\partial \mathbf{y}} + \frac{\partial \mathbf{y}}{\partial \mathbf{x}}$</answer>
<answer>$\frac{\partial \mathbf{z}}{\partial \mathbf{x}} = (\frac{\partial \mathbf{z}}{\partial \mathbf{y}})^T \frac{\partial \mathbf{y}}{\partial \mathbf{x}}$</answer>
</answers>
<explanation>The Pen &amp; Paper Solutions, Section 1.1 ("Chain rule for Jacobians"), states this rule for Jacobians. It's also implied on Slide 7 of the second lecture ("Chain Rule with Vectors"), where $\frac{\partial z}{\partial \mathbf{y}}$ would be a row vector (gradient transpose) if $z$ is scalar, or a Jacobian if $z$ is vector. The standard matrix multiplication order for Jacobians is $\frac{\partial \mathbf{z}}{\partial \mathbf{y}} \frac{\partial \mathbf{y}}{\partial \mathbf{x}}$.</explanation>

<question>In backpropagation for an MLP, if $\delta^l_i = \frac{\partial R}{\partial z^l_i}$ is the error signal at the output $z^l_i$ (post-activation) of neuron $i$ in layer $l$, and $z^l_i = \tanh(a^l_i)$ where $a^l_i = \sum_j W^l_{ij} z^{l-1}_j + b^l_i$, how is the gradient of the loss $R$ with respect to the weight $W^l_{ij}$ computed?</question>
<answers>
<answer correct="true">$\frac{\partial R}{\partial W^l_{ij}} = \delta^l_i (1 - \tanh^2(a^l_i)) z^{l-1}_j$</answer>
<answer>$\frac{\partial R}{\partial W^l_{ij}} = \delta^l_i z^{l-1}_j$</answer>
<answer>$\frac{\partial R}{\partial W^l_{ij}} = \delta^l_i (1 - \tanh^2(a^l_i)) W^l_{ij}$</answer>
<answer>$\frac{\partial R}{\partial W^l_{ij}} = \sum_k \delta^{l+1}_k (1 - \tanh^2(a^{l+1}_k)) z^{l-1}_j$</answer>
</answers>
<explanation>This uses the chain rule: $\frac{\partial R}{\partial W^l_{ij}} = \frac{\partial R}{\partial z^l_i} \frac{\partial z^l_i}{\partial a^l_i} \frac{\partial a^l_i}{\partial W^l_{ij}}$.
We have $\frac{\partial R}{\partial z^l_i} = \delta^l_i$.
$\frac{\partial z^l_i}{\partial a^l_i} = \frac{d}{da^l_i} \tanh(a^l_i) = (1 - \tanh^2(a^l_i))$.
$\frac{\partial a^l_i}{\partial W^l_{ij}} = z^{l-1}_j$.
Combining these gives $\delta^l_i (1 - \tanh^2(a^l_i)) z^{l-1}_j$. This matches the derivation in the Pen &amp;Paper Solutions (page 4, combining results for $\frac{\partial R}{\partial w_{ij}^l} = \delta^l \frac{\partial z^l}{\partial w_{ij}^l}$ with $\frac{\partial z^l}{\partial w_{ij}^l} = \text{diag}(1-\tanh^2(a^l)) \cdot \text{vec}_i^T( (z^{l-1})^T )$ and simplifying for the scalar weight). Also aligns with slide 20 of the second lecture if $\delta_j^{[l]}$ is interpreted as post-activation error and $\sigma_j'$ is the derivative of the activation.</explanation>

<question>In the intuitive explanation of backpropagation (Slides 9-11, Second Lecture), if the goal is to increase the output value of a neuron, and a weight $w_k$ connects to an activation $a_k$ that is very small (close to zero), how much influence will changing $w_k$ have on the output, according to this intuition?</question>
<answers>
<answer correct="true">Very little influence, as the effect is proportional to the activation $a_k$.</answer>
<answer>Significant influence, as small activations are more sensitive to weight changes.</answer>
<answer>The influence depends only on the magnitude of the weight $w_k$, not $a_k$.</answer>
<answer>The influence will be negative, counteracting the desired increase.</answer>
</answers>
<explanation>The intuition (and the math shown on Slide 12 of the second lecture, $\frac{\partial L}{\partial w_1} \propto a_1$) suggests that the change in loss due to a weight is proportional to the activation connected through that weight. If $a_k$ is small, the impact of changing $w_k$ is also small.</explanation>

<question>When backpropagating error to a hidden layer (Slide 15, Second Lecture), the error signal for a neuron in that hidden layer is computed by:</question>
<answers>
<answer correct="true">Summing the weighted error signals from all neurons in the subsequent layer that it connects to (its "parents" in the forward pass).</answer>
<answer>Averaging the error signals from all neurons in the subsequent layer.</answer>
<answer>Taking the maximum error signal from any neuron in the subsequent layer it connects to.</answer>
<answer>Multiplying its own activation by the learning rate.</answer>
</answers>
<explanation>Slide 15 of the second lecture ("Backpropagation: Hidden Layer") shows with an arrow and text "Sum over the backpropagated values from each parent!". This means the error at a hidden neuron is an aggregation of how it contributed to the errors of the neurons it feeds into.</explanation>

<question>According to the Universal Approximation Theorem (Slide 30, Second Lecture), while one hidden layer is theoretically enough to approximate any continuous function, what is often observed in practice regarding network depth?</question>
<answers>
<answer correct="true">Deeper networks (more layers) often perform better.</answer>
<answer>Shallower networks (fewer layers) are almost always preferred for simplicity and speed.</answer>
<answer>Network depth has no significant impact on performance if the width is sufficient.</answer>
<answer>Optimal performance is always achieved with exactly two hidden layers.</answer>
</answers>
<explanation>Slide 30 of the second lecture ("Universal approximation theorem") states: "One layer is enough in theory. In practice deeper is better." Slide 42 also mentions "In practice, deeper networks work better."</explanation>

<question>The "bump" function, which can be created by a small neural network with sigmoid activations (Slides 35-37, Second Lecture), is constructed by:</question>
<answers>
<answer correct="true">Subtracting one step-like function (approximated by a sigmoid) from another, slightly shifted step-like function.</answer>
<answer>Multiplying two sigmoid functions together.</answer>
<answer>Applying a sigmoid function to a quadratic input.</answer>
<answer>Using a special "bump" activation function in the hidden layer.</answer>
</answers>
<explanation>Slide 37 of the second lecture shows how a "Bump function" is formed. The illustration implies two hidden neurons creating step-like outputs (s1, s2) and the output neuron combining them with weights (h1, h2 = -0.5, suggesting one adds and the other subtracts, or effectively a difference of sigmoids).</explanation>

<question>One implication drawn from the "Randomization Test" experiments (Zhang et al., 2017), as discussed on Slide 51 of the second lecture, is that:</question>
<answers>
<answer correct="true">Neural networks don't necessarily learn in the same way humans do, given their ability to memorize random data.</answer>
<answer>Explicit regularizers are the primary reason for good generalization in deep neural networks.</answer>
<answer>Neural networks can only fit data if the labels are mostly correct.</answer>
<answer>The capacity of neural networks is generally too low to fit complex datasets.</answer>
</answers>
<explanation>Slide 51 of the second lecture ("What does this mean?") states: "NNs don't really learn how humans learn." and "NNs easily overfit to random labels." This suggests a different learning mechanism than human-like understanding.</explanation>

<question>In the "critical regime" of the double descent phenomenon (where Effective Model Complexity EMC $\approx n$, the number of samples), how does increasing model complexity typically affect test error (Slide 58, Second Lecture)?</question>
<answers>
<answer correct="true">Test error may decrease or increase.</answer>
<answer>Test error will always decrease.</answer>
<answer>Test error will always increase.</answer>
<answer>Test error remains constant.</answer>
</answers>
<explanation>Slide 58 of the second lecture ("Hypotheses - Given n Samples for Training") states: "If EMCD,$\epsilon$(T) $\approx n$: we are in the critical regime – increasing T’s complexity will decrease or increase test error."</explanation>

<question>The "Grokking" phenomenon (Power et al., 2022) observed in training neural networks on algorithmic tasks shows that:</question>
<answers>
<answer correct="true">Almost perfect generalization can happen much later in training, way after the model has perfectly fit (interpolated) the training data.</answer>
<answer>Generalization only occurs if the model achieves zero training error very quickly.</answer>
<answer>Smaller models are more likely to exhibit grokking than larger models.</answer>
<answer>Grokking is primarily a result of using specific optimizers like AdamW.</answer>
</answers>
<explanation>Slide 56 of the second lecture ("Grokking") states: "Almost perfect generalization happens way after the interpolation threshold!" The plot shows the validation accuracy (generalization) improving significantly long after training accuracy has reached 100%.</explanation>

<question>In the backpropagation derivation for an MLP (Page 3 of Exercises), the error signal for layer $l$ is defined as $\delta^l := \frac{\partial R}{\partial z^l}$. How is $\delta^l$ expressed in terms of $\delta^{l+1}$ and the Jacobian $\frac{\partial z^{l+1}}{\partial z^l}$?</question>
<answers>
<answer correct="true">$(\delta^l)^T = (\delta^{l+1})^T \frac{\partial z^{l+1}}{\partial z^l}$ (or $\delta^l = (\frac{\partial z^{l+1}}{\partial z^l})^T \delta^{l+1}$ if $\delta$ are column vectors)</answer>
<answer>$\delta^l = \delta^{l+1} \frac{\partial z^{l+1}}{\partial z^l}$</answer>
<answer>$\delta^l = \frac{\partial z^{l+1}}{\partial z^l} \delta^{l+1}$</answer>
<answer>$\delta^l = \delta^{l+1} + \frac{\partial z^{l+1}}{\partial z^l}$</answer>
</answers>
<explanation>Page 3 of the Pen &amp;Paper Solutions, Section 2a, shows the derivation: $\delta^l = \frac{\partial R}{\partial z^l} = \frac{\partial R}{\partial z^{l+1}} \frac{\partial z^{l+1}}{\partial z^l} = \delta^{l+1} \frac{\partial z^{l+1}}{\partial z^l}$. The dimensions and whether they are row/column vectors would determine precise transpose placement. The core idea is multiplication by the Jacobian. If $\delta$ are column vectors, the chain rule for gradients gives $\nabla_{z^l}R = (\frac{\partial z^{l+1}}{\partial z^l})^T \nabla_{z^{l+1}}R$, so $\delta^l = (\frac{\partial z^{l+1}}{\partial z^l})^T \delta^{l+1}$. The first option correctly reflects this relationship given typical Jacobian definitions and row/column vector conventions for gradients. The exercise itself seems to use $\delta^l$ as a row vector for $\frac{\partial R}{\partial z^l}$, in which case $(\delta^l) = (\delta^{l+1}) \frac{\partial z^{l+1}}{\partial z^l}$ is appropriate if $\delta^{l+1}$ is also a row vector. The core is the product with the Jacobian. The option chosen reflects the standard gradient vector propagation.</explanation>
